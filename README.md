# Rusted
A Rusty text-based game built from the ground-up.
## Abstract
Welcome fellows :eyes: 
I want to create a text-based game entirely from scratch. This will be both a creative and technical endeavour with a lot room for autonomy for everyone involved, think of it as a learning opportunity and something for the ol' portfolio :wink:
**Why have I chosen a game as a portfolio project?**
Game design is an endeavour that heavily leans on creativity as well as technicality, so in short: It's inclusive af. There will more than likely be a place for you in the development cycle no-matter your interests (as long as you are interested in *something*).
**Why should it be text-based?**
Let's face it, we're not Bethesda. We don't have the resources to create a fully-fledged game in our free time without either killing ourselves with the workload or scoping the project down to the point it's barely an endeavour anymore.
However, text-based games give us an out to this problem:
- They require little-to-no artistic contributions and the contributions that can be made are both meaningful and manageable in scope.
  - This could involve story-telling, text-art, sound design or world building.
- They are simple enough to make it feasible to build without an existing engine, but complex enough to be genuinely technically challenging.

**What's my vision at the time of writing this?**
I want:
- To take full advantage of the text-based medium and reimagine it for the modern world of games.
- To have some killer world building, lore, character building and storytelling.
- A game where choices are meaningful.
- A game that involves some genuinely impressive levels of background computation and simulation. 
- A user-friendly interface that retains the aesthetic of Zork but is much more than a simple command line.
  - Think Undertale. Think using the style, sizing and position of text to enhance the experience. Conversations could have each speaker's contributions on different sides of the screen. Think auto-correct for available actions.
- Something that I can be proud of.
## Inspirations:
- Darkwood
  - Surviving through the night in a fortified building / location
  - Scavenging a hostile terrain during the day to survive the night
  - Changing base in order to progress in the story, but each base increases difficulty
- This War of Mine
  - Recruiting people to aid in your endeavours
  - Each person comes with a backstory, traumas, skills, hopes and attachments which affects gameplay
  - Could maybe switch perspectives when accomplishing certain tasks? Combat, exploring etc.
- Dwarf Fortress
  - Designation of jobs and posts for members of the group
  - Every member of colony is a simulated entity
  - Rogue-like top-down map design could be adapted for a more modern audience?
## Implementation Plans
The core of the engine should be implemented in Rust, C and C++ (with maybe some Go?). It needs to be as fast and thread-safe as possible.
The user interface can be done in anything, even a Framework. (React Native, anyone?)
